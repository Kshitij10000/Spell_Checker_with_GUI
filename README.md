# Spell_Checker_with_GUI
The Spell Checker project is a Python application that provides users with a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) for spell-checking text input. This project utilizes the Tkinter library to create the GUI interface and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to check the spelling of words against a dictionary.
