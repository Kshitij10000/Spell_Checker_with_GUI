Project Title: Spell Checker with GUI using Python and Tkinter

Project Description:
The Spell Checker project is a Python application that provides users with a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) for spell-checking text input. This project utilizes the Tkinter library to create the GUI interface and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to check the spelling of words against a dictionary.

Features:
User-Friendly GUI: The project provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to input text and check the spelling of the words.
Dynamic Spell Checking: The spell checker dynamically checks the spelling of words as the user types. Any misspelled words are highlighted in red.
Interactive Scrolled Text: The application uses a scrolled text widget, allowing users to input and edit large amounts of text comfortably.
Word Dictionary: The NLTK library is used to download and access a comprehensive English word dictionary. The application compares user input against this dictionary to determine word correctness.

How It Works:
As the user types or edits text in the input area, the application detects key releases and triggers the check method.
The check method retrieves the current text content from the input area.
It counts the number of spaces to determine if the text has been modified since the last check.
If there have been changes (e.g., new words added or edited), the method tokenizes the text into words, cleans them by removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting them to lowercase.
Each word is then checked against the NLTK dictionary. If a word is not found in the dictionary, it is considered misspelled.
Misspelled words are highlighted in red in the input area to draw the user's attention to potential spelling errors.

How to Use:
Launch the application.
Type or paste text into the input area.
As you type, the application will automatically check the spelling of words and highlight any misspelled words in red.
Review the text for spelling errors and make corrections as needed.

Dependencies:
Python 3.x
Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) - You can install it using nltk.download("words")

Project Improvement Ideas:
Implement a suggestion system to provide users with suggested corrections for misspelled words.
Add support for multiple languages by including dictionaries for other languages.
Save the corrected text to a file or provide an option for exporting the text.
Allow users to customize the highlighting color for misspelled words.
Implement keyboard shortcuts and context menus for enhanced user interaction.
